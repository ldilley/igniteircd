Special characters used with I: lines in ircd.conf:

   -  This will never put a '~' for a user not running identd
   +  This will force people matching this I: to require identd
   !  This means to only allow 1 connection per IP address in this I:
   $  (Not used in Ignite)
   ^  This will exempt a user from K/G: lines (limited protection from D: lines)
   &  User can run bots
   >  This user is exempt from I: line/server side connection limits
   _  This user is exempt from G: lines
   =  Spoof this user's IP (normally only used for opers)
   <  This user is exempt from idle restrictions if IDLE_CHECK is defined

Allow X connection(s) per IP for users @somedomain.net where X is provided in the Y: line
If there is no '!' and you have a limit in your Y: line, then it matches the full user@host instead of just host.
I:X::!*@somedomain.net::1

Never show a '~' even though user is not running identd
I:X::-*@somedomain.net::1

User is exempt from K/G: lines
I:NOMATCH::^user@somedomain.net::3

User can run a bot and is also E: lined
I:NOMATCH::&user@somedomain.net::3

User is immune from I: line limites
I:NOMATCH::>user@somedomain.net::3

User can run a bot and is exempt from client connection limits
I:NOMATCH::^&>user@somedomain.net::3

Show this user as being user@spoofed.org
I:spoofed.org::=user@somedomain.net::3

Oper/Admin commands: ('+' indicates that /quote must be used)

  CLOSE    - CLOSE
             Close any connections from clients who have not fully registered yet.
  CONNECT  - CONNECT <server> [port]
             Initiates link with <server> on [port].
  DIE      - DIE [reason]
             Terminates the IRC server with optional [reason].
+ DLINE    - DLINE <nick|IP> :[reason]
             Adds a DLINE to ircd.conf or klines.conf
             which will deny any connections from the banned IP address.
             The banned client will receive a message saying they are banned with [reason].
             In order to use <nick> rather than <IP>, <nick> must be on your server.
+ DNS      - DNS
             Displays stats about Ignite asynchronous resolving code.
+ FJOIN    - FJOIN <nick> <channel>
             Forces <nick> to join <channel>.
+ FNICK    - FNICK <nick> <new nick>
             Force nickname change from <nick> to <new nick>.
+ GLINE    - GLINE <user@host> :[reason]
             -- If compiled with GLINE --
             Attempts to add a global IRC network wide ban on <user@host> for [reason].
             It takes three different Opers/Admins on three different
             servers to do the same GLINE within a short interval
             to have a GLINE triggered for a compiled time of hours.
+ HASH     - HASH
             Displays stats about Ignite internal hashes.
+ HTM      - HTM [option]
             When no [option] is given, HTM shows the current
             High Traffic Mode rate and whether HTM is ON or OFF.
             [option] can be one of the following:
               ON        - Forces High Traffic Mode ON. With
                           this on, Ignite is more efficient in
                           reading server-to-server and Oper/Admin traffic, but will be less efficient
                           than normal with regular client traffic.
               OFF       - Forces High Traffic Mode OFF.
               TO <rate> - Sets the High Traffic Mode <rate>. Ignite will automatically go
                           into High Traffic Mode once <rate> is reached, and will automatically turn
                           it off when things calm down.
               QUIET     - When set, Ignite will not notify Opers/Admins when it goes into and out of High
                           Traffic Mode.
               NOISY     - When set, Ignite will notify Opers/Admins when it goes into and out of High
                           Traffic Mode.
  KILL     - KILL <nick> [reason]
             Removes <nick> from your network with [reason].
+ KLINE    - KLINE <nick|user@host> :[reason]
             Adds a KLINE to ircd.conf or klines.conf which
             will ban the specified user from using that server.
             The banned client will receive a message saying they are banned with [reason].
             The reason can contain a '|' character.  Anything before the '|' will be shown
             to the victim, anything after will not.
             For a temporary KLINE, length of KLINE is given in minutes as the first parameter:
             KLINE 10 <nick|user@host> :Banned 10 minutes
+ LOCOPS   - LOCOPS :<message>
             Sends <message> to all Opers/Admins on local server with UMODE +w and +z.
+ LTRACE   - LTRACE [server|nick]
             Displays only Oper/Admin and server information.
+ LWALLOPS - LWALLOPS :<message>
             Sends <message> to all Opers/Admins on local server with UMODE +w and +z.
+ OPERWALL - OPERWALL :<message>
             Sends <message> to all Opers/Admins who are UMODE +w and +z.
  REHASH   - REHASH [option]
             When no [option] is given, Ignite will re-read ircd.conf.
             [option] can be one of the following:
               DNS     - Read /etc/resolv.conf
               IP      - Reloads the IP hash for improved ACKPATCH
               TKLINES - Clears temporary KLINEs
               GLINES  - Clears G: Lines
               GC      - Performs garbage collecting of excess memory

               MAX        - Sets the number of max connections to <value>.

                            Disable using 0.
               SMALLNET   - Below this number of servers present

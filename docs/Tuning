  Ignite is configured to serve approximately 100 clients out of the box. This is adjustable to suit the needs of
your network. Most average personal servers do not see more than 100 simultaneous clients hence the stock setting.

  You can easily tune your Ignite IRCd to use less memory on startup by modifying the "list.c" source module in /src. 

These two macros will be found in "list.c".

#define LINK_PREALLOCATE 128

#define CLIENTS_PREALLOCATE 128

  You may modify these numbers to fit your estimated
needs. You could use 64 for each for example, on a server that 
normally never saw more than 60 clients on the entire network.

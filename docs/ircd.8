.SH SYNOPSIS
.hy 0
.IP \fBircd\fP
[-vn] [-f filename] [-d filename] [-k filename] [-h servername]
[-l filename] [-x level]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
\fIircd\fP is the server (daemon) program for the Internet Relay Chat
Program.  The \fIircd\fP is a server in that its function is to "serve"
the client program \fIirc(1)\fP with messages and commands.  All commands
and user messages are passed directly to the \fIircd\fP for processing
and relaying to other ircd sites.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B \-f filename
Specifies the ircd.conf file to be used for this ircdaemon. The option
is used to override the default ircd.conf given at compile time, if
CMDLINE_CONFIG is defined.
.TP
.B \-d filename
Specifies the D-line file to be used.  This file is used for both reading
D-lines at startup, and writing to while \fIircd\fP is running.
.TP
.B \-k filename
Specifies the K-line file to be used.  This file is used for both reading
K-lines at startup, and writing to while \fIircd\fP is running.
.TP
.B \-h servername
Specifies the name of the IRC server.  This overrides the setting in
ircd.conf.
.TP
.B \-l filename
Specifies an alternative logfile to be used than that specified in config.h
.TP
.B \-n
Makes \fIircd\fP run in the foreground, and, if -x is also specified, output
debugging information to stdout.
.TP
.B \-v
Makes \fIircd\fP print its version, and exit.
.TP
.B \-x <level>
Sets \fIircd\fP's debug level to <level>.
.SH USAGE
If you plan to connect your \fIircd\fP server to an existing Irc-Network,
you will need to alter your local IRC configuration file (typically named
"ircd.conf") so that it will accept and make connections to other \fIircd\fP
servers.  This file contains the hostnames, Network Addresses, and
passwords for connections to other ircds around the world.  Because 
description of the actual file format of the "ircd.conf" file is beyond the
scope of this document, please refer to the file example.conf in the IRC source
files documentation directory.

.SH BOOTING THE SERVER
The \fIircd\fP server can be started as part of the
Unix boot procedure or just by placing the server into Unix Background.
Keep in mind that if it is \fBnot\fP part of your Unix's boot-up procedure 
then you will have to manually start the \fIircd\fP server each time your
Unix is rebooted.  This means if your Unix is prone to crashing
or going for for repairs a lot it would make sense to start the \fIircd\fP
server as part of your UNIX bootup procedure.

automatically detach itself from tty.
